# Hackathon-Defaulter-Student-Management
To manage defaulter students effectively, first, collect attendance data in an Excel sheet. The sheet should include columns for student names, attendance percentages, and any other relevant details. Next, analyze the data to determine which students have attendance percentages below the predefined threshold. For those students identified as defaulters, generate a detailed attendance report. Send this report to the respective teacher to keep them informed. Additionally, dispatch personalized emails to the defaulter students and their parents, outlining the attendance issue and any necessary actions to improve attendance. This structured approach ensures timely communication and accountability in addressing attendance concerns.
